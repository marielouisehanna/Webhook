# Trying The Webhook Method

## Webhook:
A webhook allows an application to send real-time data to another application. </br>
In the context of Jenkins and GitHub, a webhook is a mechanism used by GitHub to notify Jenkins of repository changes. </br>
Jenkins will then automatically build and test the code in response to the webhook notification. The webhook triggers a build. </br>
