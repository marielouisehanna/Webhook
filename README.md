# Trying The Webhook Method

## Webhook:
A webhook allows an application to send real-time data to another application. </br>
In the context of Jenkins and GitHub, a webhook is a mechanism used by GitHub to notify Jenkins of repository changes. </br>
Jenkins will then automatically build and test the code in response to the webhook notification. The webhook triggers a build. </br>

## What i am doing 
1. created the jenkinsfile where i put the pipeline code 
2. added the credentials in jenkins 
3. used ngrok for the URL </br>
   (You cannot receive webhooks locally unless you are tunneling external requests)
4. create a new job in Jenkins using the jenknsfile </br>
‚ö†Ô∏è Rename it master not main (it will give an error) </br>
‚ö†Ô∏è put the GitHub hook trigger for GITScm polling option in jenkins</br>
‚ö†Ô∏è  </br>

Current error üëéüèª:</br> 
/var/jenkins_home/workspace/webhoook@tmp/durable-573eb755/script.sh.copy: 1: terraform: not found
</br> 
possible solution:</br> 
On your build environment you need to find out where terraform is installed and ensure that is on the path.</br> 
If not you need to add the directory to the agent path on Jenkins.
